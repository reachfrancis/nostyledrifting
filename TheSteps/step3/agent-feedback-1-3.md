Workspace: Collecting workspace information# Implementation Strategy for Typography Property Extraction

## Building on Previous Work

Having already implemented the SCSS Parser functionality (story 1.2), I'll use its output AST structure and dependency resolution capabilities as the foundation for implementing typography property extraction. The parser provides the syntactic structure we need to accurately extract and analyze typography-specific properties.

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Core Module Development

I'll structure this implementation into several interconnected modules:

- **TypographyExtractorEngine**: The central component that will traverse the AST nodes to identify typography properties
- **PropertyExtractors**: Specialized extractors for each typography property type (font-family, font-size, etc.)
- **VariableResolutionSystem**: For resolving SCSS variables and CSS custom properties to concrete values
- **MediaQueryAnalyzer**: For handling responsive typography across breakpoints
- **FontFaceProcessor**: For processing @font-face declarations

### 2. Data Flow Pipeline

The implementation will follow this data flow:

1. SCSS AST from the parser → Typography Extractor Engine
2. For each node → Check if it's a typography property
3. If yes → Extract with appropriate property extractor
4. For each value → Resolve variables and evaluate functions
5. Create TypographyEntry objects → Aggregate into analysis result
6. Process media queries → Build responsive typography maps

### 3. Key Technical Challenges & Solutions

#### Variable Resolution
I'll implement a multi-stage resolution process that:
- Tracks variable scope and dependencies
- Resolves nested variable references
- Handles circular dependencies with proper error reporting

#### Function Evaluation
For calc(), clamp(), and other CSS functions, I'll implement:
- An AST-based expression parser
- Unit-aware calculation engine
- Approximation for browser-relative units

#### Media Query Processing
I'll implement a media query analyzer that:
- Extracts breakpoint information
- Tracks property changes across breakpoints
- Builds a cascade model for styling at specific viewport sizes

### 4. Performance Optimizations

I'll implement both caching strategies and streaming extraction:

- **Caching**: Using the defined `TypographyCache` interface to avoid redundant calculations
- **Streaming**: Processing large files in chunks to optimize memory usage

### 5. Error Handling & Recovery

I'll implement robust error handling with specific recovery strategies for:
- Missing variables
- Function evaluation errors
- Malformed values
- Circular dependencies

### 6. Testing Strategy

I'll develop comprehensive tests covering:
- Unit tests for individual extractors
- Integration tests for the complete extraction pipeline
- Performance tests with large datasets
- Edge case tests for error recovery

## Implementation Phases

1. **Core Property Extraction**: Basic implementation of typography property extraction
2. **Variable Resolution System**: Resolution of SCSS variables and custom properties
3. **Function Evaluation**: Support for calc(), clamp(), and other CSS functions
4. **Media Query Support**: Handling of responsive typography
5. **Font Face Processing**: Processing of @font-face declarations
6. **Analysis & Output**: Implementation of analysis capabilities and output formats
7. **Performance Optimization**: Caching and streaming implementation
8. **Testing & Refinement**: Comprehensive testing and refinement

This implementation will deliver the complete typography property extraction functionality while maintaining extensibility for future enhancements like typography scale detection and accessibility analysis.
