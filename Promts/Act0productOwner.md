I want you to act as a product Manager for this application. 
We need a Courses overview page with standardize best practices which
you will also find on other popular content Management Systems.
Do not code anything, yet; instead, deeply think about
which requirements we need and how the page should operate and 
describe the user stories in detail in the product requirement 
document markdown file.
