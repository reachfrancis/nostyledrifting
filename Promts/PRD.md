Product Requirements Document: Angular UI Style Comparison Utility (Revised with Typography & Accessibility)
Executive Summary
This document outlines the requirements for a utility that compares UI styling between two Angular application directories, focusing exclusively on SCSS-based visual changes with special emphasis on typography and accessibility implications. The tool is specifically designed for Angular applications that follow standard practices of using SCSS files and separate template files.

Problem Statement
When reviewing Angular application updates, teams struggle to efficiently identify and assess purely visual changes across SCSS files, particularly those that impact typography readability and accessibility compliance. Manual comparison of SCSS files across numerous components is time-consuming and error-prone, and often misses subtle changes that can break WCAG compliance or degrade user experience. This utility addresses the need for automated detection and reporting of SCSS-specific modifications in Angular applications with built-in accessibility validation.

Objectives
Primary Goals
Automate detection of SCSS changes between Angular applications
Flag typography changes that impact readability
Identify accessibility-breaking style modifications
Parse and compare component-specific SCSS files
Track Angular Material theme modifications
Generate actionable reports for style review
Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is maintained
Reduce manual SCSS review time by 90%

Risk Classifications:

Critical: WCAG failures, contrast issues
High: Typography readability degradation
Medium: Minor spacing/sizing changes
Low: Non-impacting visual updates

Success Criteria (Enhanced)
Quantitative Metrics
100% detection of WCAG contrast failures
Identify all typography hierarchy changes
Flag 95% of focus-related modifications
Zero false positives for critical accessibility issues
Qualitative Metrics
Clear accessibility impact communication
Typography change visualization
Designer-friendly readability reports
Actionable accessibility remediation steps
Testing Scenarios (Additional)

Risks & Mitigation (Additional)
Risk: Complex color calculations in SCSS Mitigation: Resolve SCSS color functions before contrast calculation

Risk: Dynamic theme switching contrast validation Mitigation: Test all theme combinations automatically

Risk: Custom focus indicators may not be detected Mitigation: Comprehensive pseudo-class parsing

This revision adds comprehensive typography and accessibility analysis capabilities, ensuring that style changes are evaluated not just for visual differences but for their impact on readability and accessibility compliance. Sent from the all new AOL app for iOS
