Explore the entire repository thoroughly, reviewing and analyzing the codebase from 
the perspectives of a software architect, software developer, and product manager.

Your task is to create a comprehensive Markdown document titled `Codebase_Overview.md` placed at the root of the repository. 
This document should extensively cover the following areas:

### 1. Project Overview

* Clearly describe the purpose, functionality, and goals of the application.
* Summarize the key features and modules.

### 2. Technical Architecture

* Detail the overall system architecture, including:

  * Data flow and interactions between different components
  * Any APIs, databases, and external integrations

### 3. Codebase Structure

* Outline the directory and file organization, clearly explaining the purpose of critical folders and files.
* Highlight best practices or notable patterns used

### 4. Key Technologies and Dependencies

* List and describe the main technologies, frameworks, libraries, and tools used in the repository.
* Explain why these specific technologies were chosen.


### 6. Deployment and CI/CD

* Outline the deployment processes and configurations.
* Describe any continuous integration/continuous deployment pipelines currently in use.

### 7. Mermaid Diagrams

* Create clear and detailed Mermaid diagrams for:

  * System architecture overview
  * Data flow diagrams
  * Component interaction diagrams (if applicable)

### 8. Observations and Recommendations

* Provide a section for observations about the current architecture and code quality.
* Suggest potential improvements or refactoring opportunities clearly stating their benefits.

The document must be structured clearly, thoroughly, and professionally, providing both 
high-level and detailed views to facilitate understanding by team members across different roles.
